    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      “Murgh” translates to chicken, and “Kari” refers to curry, which
      encompasses a wide range of dishes characterized by a sauce or gravy
      seasoned with a blend of spices. Murgh Kari, therefore, is simply chicken
      cooked in a flavorful curry sauce. However, the beauty of Murgh Kari lies
      in its adaptability. Every region, family, and cook has their own unique
      take, resulting in a myriad of variations based on spice blends, cooking
      techniques, and preferred ingredients.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ cup cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. Heat oil in a large
        skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in
        batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken
        breasts to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil
        remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and
        translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric,
        coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture;
        allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt
        to the mixture; stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate.
        Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat
        with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the
        chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in
        the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
    </ol>
