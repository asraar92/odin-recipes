    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Carrot halwa is a traditional Indian dessert that uses the carrot in a
      unique way. This dish is basically composed of grated cooked carrots with
      some additional ingredients. A major dairy component also adds to the
      dish. One of the first stages of making carrot halwa involves frying or
      saut√©ing nuts and other items in butter or clarified butter. Some cooks
      use a South Asian clarified butter called ghee. This provides a sort of
      base for the dish and helps to prevent burning when the dish is cooked in
      a pan. Along with nuts, some cooks add raisins to the dish. This gives the
      finished product an additional sweet flavor. Other cooks add more
      sweeteners such as powdered sugar or similar products.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 cups shredded carrots</li>
      <li>8 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar</li>
      <li>24 green cardamom pods or 1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dry- roasted pistachio nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine carrots, milk, and sugar in a 6- to 8-qt. Dutch oven; bring to a
        boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has
        evaporated, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin to break open
        cardamom pods. Coarsely crush seeds, discarding the shells. (If using
        ground cardamom, skip this step.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook half of
        cardamom until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add carrot mixture and cook,
        stirring constantly, until thick and jammy, about 15 minutes. Remove
        from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in remaining cardamom. Sprinkle with almonds and pistachios just
        before serving. (Chill in an airtight container up to 5 days; freeze up
        to 3 months.)
      </li>
    </ol>
